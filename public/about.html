<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jacob Glueckert and I'm from Charlotte NC. I grew up in Oneonta NY where I spent most of my time gallivanting around with my friends. 
  I went to college at Ithaca College where I majored in Sound Recording Technology. 
</p>

<p>I graduated in 2021 and moved to Charlotte NC with my friend who I am currently in a band with. I currently work for Riverside.fm as a Solution Engineer.
  Through my job, I found that I enjoy problem solving and working with tech and wanted to learn more about programming and building software. 
  I have no prior experience with coding or programming, so I'm learning one step at a time and enjoying it a lot so far!
</p>

<p>In my spare time, I work on new music for my band. I love to read, play games with friends, and am trying to get better at Tennis!
